        <li><em>Challenges: </em>Some challenges I had incuded figuring out how to separate everything into boxes. To solve this I resorted to using a grid layout. I also had a hard time positioning the add tweet button and making it a sticky icon. I could not figure this out in time.</li>
        <li><em>What Did I Learn:</em> I learned the basics of css in this assignment. It gave me great insight as to how organized one must be to efficiently use css and how many ways there are to do a certain thing. I knew nothing coming into this assignment.</li>
        <li><em>Resources Used: </em> I used the MDN tutorials on CSS mostly. I looked up how to use things like boxes and positioning on MDN and it was very helpful for me</li>
        <li><em>Googled Topics: </em> I had to google how to use the grid style. I also had to google how to use the focus animation.</li>
      </ul>
